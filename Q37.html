        Your management has asked an external auditor to review all the resources in a specific project. The security team has enabled the Organization Policy called
        Domain Restricted Sharing on the organization node by specifying only your Cloud Identity domain. You want the auditor to only be able to view, but not modify, the resources in that project. What should you do?
    </p>

    <form id="Q2_1" onsubmit="checkAnswers()" action="">
        <label><input type="radio" name="Question" value="radio" id="Question 0">Ask the auditor for their Google account, and give them the Viewer role on the project.</label></br>
        <label><input type="radio" name="Question" value="radio" id="Question 1">Ask the auditor for their Google account, and give them the Security Reviewer role on the project.</label></br>
        <label><input type="radio" name="Question" value="radio" id="Question 2"> Create a temporary account for the auditor in Cloud Identity, and give that account the Viewer role on the project.</label></br>
        <label><input type="radio" name="Question" value="radio" id="Question 3"> Create a temporary account for the auditor in Cloud Identity, and give that account the Security Reviewer role on the project.</label></br>
        </br>

        <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" />
