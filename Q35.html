        You have successfully created a development environment in a project for an application. This application uses Compute Engine and Cloud SQL. Now you need to create a production environment for this application. The security team has forbidden the existence of network routes between these 2 environments and has asked you to follow Google-recommended practices. What should you do?

    </p>

    <form id="Q2_1" onsubmit="checkAnswers()" action="">
        <label><input type="radio" name="Question" value="radio" id="Question 0"> Create a new project, enable the Compute Engine and Cloud SQL APIs in that project, and replicate the setup you have created in the development environment.</label></br>
        <label><input type="radio" name="Question" value="radio" id="Question 1"> Create a new production subnet in the existing VPC and a new production Cloud SQL instance in your existing project, and deploy your application using those resources.</label></br>
        <label><input type="radio" name="Question" value="radio" id="Question 2">Create a new project, modify your existing VPC to be a Shared VPC, share that VPC with your new project, and replicate the setup you have in the development environment in that new project in the Shared VPC.</label></br>
        <label><input type="radio" name="Question" value="radio" id="Question 3"> Ask the security team to grant you the Project Editor role in an existing production project used by another division of your company. Once they grant you that role, replicate the setup you have in the development environment in that project.</label></br>
        </br>

        <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" />
